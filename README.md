## Instructions

This starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I converted this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML file, but primarily the JavaScript file.

I started by opening `js/app.js` and started building out the app's functionality.

The game works like a usual memory game. Bootstrap and Google fonts are used (https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.6.1/css/font-awesome.min.css / https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Coda).
The game can be started by the restarter icon or by refreshing the site. If you need less than 25 moves you will stay on 3 stars, till 49 there will be a 2 star rating.

For specific, detailed instructions of this here solved task , look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
